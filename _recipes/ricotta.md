ingredients:
- 8 cups whole milk 2 liters
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice or white vinegar

directions:
- Line a colander with a large piece of lightly dampened cheesecloth that has been folded over itself at least 3-4 times. Place the colander over a bowl. Make sure to use non-reactive materials. (Alternatively, you can use a recycled ricotta basket placed on a bowl).
- In a large heavy based saucepan, over medium heat, heat the milk.
- Add the salt and stir occasionally with a wooden spoon. Make sure the milk does not scorch.
- If you have a thermometer, heat to 185 F. If you do not have a thermometer, you need to reach a stage where there is a lot of steam, little bubbles close to the edge of the pot and the formation of a slight film. It should take about 20 minutes to get to this stage.
- Lower the heat to low.
- Add the lemon juice (or vinegar).
- Slowly agitate the mixture for 2 minutes. You will notice the curds (the ricotta) separating from the whey (yellowish liquid).
- Remove from heat.
- Cover pot and let stand for about 20 minutes.
- Carefully “ladle” your ricotta into the cheesecloth lined colander or your basket. The consistency of the final product will depend on the amount of time you leave the ricotta to drain. For a creamy ricotta, let it sit for 3-5 minutes; for a dryer ricotta, it can sit up to 20 minutes.
- Use immediately. Cover and refrigerate any leftovers.
