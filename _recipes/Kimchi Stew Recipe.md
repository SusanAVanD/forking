Kimchi Stew Recipe

My recipe is Maangchi's recipe for Kimchi Jjigae but with a twist. The twist with adding more vegetables and using shortcuts. This version adds beans sprouts, shallots, cabbage, and zuchinnis.

Ingredients 

1 pound kimchi, cut into bite size pieces
¼ cup kimchi brine
½ pound pork belly
1 package of tofu 
3 green onions
1 medium onion, sliced
2 small shallots
2 zuchinnis
0.5 Lb of bean sprouts
1 teaspoon kosher salt
2 teaspoons sugar
2 teaspoons gochugaru (Korean hot pepper flakes)
1 tablespoon gochujang (hot pepper paste)
1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
1.5L of Korean Seafood stock with Kelp made from stock tea bags

Instructions for stock
Shortcut method:
At some specialty Korean grocery stores, they sell broth teabags or broth packets filled with the dried ingredients to make a traditional Korean stock. There many types of broth teabags but purchase the one with pictures of anchovies, shrimp, kelp on their packaging. Follow the broth teabag's instructions to make a 1 - 1.5L of stock. I had some tried sea kelp on hand an have added a few pieces as well.

My personal changes to the instructions are in Step 2 and Step 6.

In Step 2 "Slice 2 green onions diagonally and add them to the pot.". 
Please add your sliced zucchninis (I perfer to cut them in matchsticks) and extra shallots in the pot.

In Step 6 "Cover and cook another 10 to 15 minutes over medium heat." 
Please add your bean sprouts in the last 5 minutes. Bean sprouts cook really quickly and it is best to add them last.
