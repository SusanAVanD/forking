ingredients:
- 24 Apples
- 02 Oranges
- 06 Cinnamon sticks
- 02 tsp Cloves (whole)
- 01 Tbsp Allspice
- 02 tsp Nutmeg (ground)
- 01 cup Maple syrup

tools:
- stock pot with lid
- knife or corer for apples
- potato masher or similar
- fine mesh strainer or cheesecloth
- pitcher

recommendations:
- apples should be 3 varieties of 8 apiece; never use more than 10 apples of one variety and aim for strong difference between varietals; for instance, one sweet, one tart, one mild
- navel oranges are preferred; stay away from sweet varieties like mandarins
- prefer grade A dark maple syrup and do not go lighter. if substituting darker, supplement with packed brown sugar to taste.

directions:
- Core and slice all apples into eighths (without skinning). Quarter the oranges and remove (but keep) the peels. In a stock pot over medium heat, add all ingredients, plus water to coat all ingredients with an additional ¼” of space.
- Bring ingredients to a rolling boil, then simmer covered for two hours. Examine after one hour and, if necessary, do some preliminary mashing (see step 3).
- After two hours have passed, use a potato masher to lightly mash the apples until shapeless. Remove the orange peels. Also remove orange flesh if desired. DO NOT MASH OVERZEALOUSLY, the release of air could cause splashing.
- After one additional hour, remove the pot from heat. Pour the cider through a fine mesh strainer or use cheesecloth to remove as many solid components as possible from the cider. Multiple strains are totally normal, the first pass usually produces 2/3-3/4 of the total yield.

Note that although I used a stock photo, I make this cider every year to great success, so I definitely recommend it!
