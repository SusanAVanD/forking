ingredients:
2 cups rolled oats
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup dried currants
1/4 cup white sugar
4 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 large egg
1/2 cup butter melted
1/3 cup milk

directions:
Step 1
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.

Step 2
Mix together oats, flour, currants, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl; make a well in the center. Beat egg in a medium bowl until frothy; stir in melted butter and milk. Pour into the well and mix until a soft dough forms.

Step 3
Transfer dough to a clean work surface. Divide dough into 2 equal pieces, then pat each piece into a 1/2-inch-thick circle. Place dough circles onto the prepared baking sheet; score each into 8 wedges.

Step 4
Bake in the preheated oven until risen and browned, about 15 minutes. Split wedges and serve warm.
